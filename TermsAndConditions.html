  This agreement is between you and Organic Products Technology Co., Ltd. This agreement might be further edited when
    necessary in the future, by Herbalkart, and will not necessarily notify you when edited. Once the newly edited version
    is published on the Herbalkart website, the new version will take effect and replace the previous version automatically.

  </p>
  <p>
  By clicking on the “Accept,” "sign up free," "upgrade your plan," or equivalent access, agreement or purchasing
    button, you or the company or entity that you represent ("you," "your," "yours" or "customer") are consenting
    to be bound by and are becoming a party to these Terms of Service. You are also representing and warranting that
    the individual clicking on the button is authorized to enter into this agreement and bind such entity.
    Your continued use of any portion of the services shall also constitute assent to the terms of these Terms
    of Service. If you are using the services on behalf of a company or other entity, then all references to
    "you" or "your" herein shall refer to both the individual and the entity.
  </p>
  <p>
  If you do not unconditionally agree to all of the terms of these Terms of Service, you will have no right
    to use the Services (and you should immediately cease all such use).  If these terms are considered an offer,
    acceptance is expressly limited to these terms to the exclusion of all other terms.
  </p>
  
  <h2>
  1.Acceptance of Terms of Service.
  </h2>
  <p>
  a. By registering for and/or using any of the Services in any manner, including visiting or browsing the
    herbalkart Website, you agree to these Terms of Service, and all other operating rules, policies,
    and procedures that we may publish from time to time through the Services, each of which is incorporated
    by reference, and each of which may be updated from time to time without notice to you.
  </p>
  <p>
  b. Certain of the Services may be subject to additional terms and conditions specified by us from time to time;
    your use of such Services is subject to those additional terms and conditions, which are incorporated into these
    Terms of Service by this reference.
  </p>


  <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>

  <p>You represent and warrant that you are at least 13 years of age. If you are under age 13, you may not,
    under any circumstances or for any reason, register for an Account (defined below) or use the Services.
    Furthermore, you must be at least 18 years of age to use any Premium Services or any other portion of the
    Services that requires you to make any payment. We may, in our sole discretion, refuse to offer the Services

    rules and regulations applicable to you and (b) do not violate any other agreement to which you are a party.

    regulation. Further, the Services are offered only for your use, and not for the use or benefit of any third party.
  </p>


  <h2>3.Registration and User Seats.</h2>

Every user has 500MB of cloud storage space.
  </p>
  <p>Plans of herbalkart Cloud include BASIC plan, PRO plan, ULTIMATE plan and ENTERPRISE plan. All the above plans can be paid monthly or yearly.</p>
  <p>You can get all new versions and updates, be minor or major, without extra cost for the future upgrade
    or maintenance. All paid features provided in the above versions are only allowed for the account owner to use.
    With group buying, each group member has his/her own personal account and all of them could use the paid features.

    Unless you have purchased an Account that expressly licenses multiple User seats
    (e.g. a "Pro plan" , "Ultimate plan"  or an “Enterprise Plan”), each Account shall only be used by the individual
    user that registered such Account. You may never use another person’s user Account without permission from
    Mockplus, or share your Account or access credentials with any other individual or entity. You should never
    publish, distribute, or post login information for your Account. "User" means an individual (a natural human!)
    whom you authorize to use the Services. Users may include, for example, your employees, consultants,
    contractors and agents, and third parties with which you transact business. If your account expressly
    allows multiple User seats, then you shall designate one User for each seat you purchase
    (and may reassign such seat to a new individual replacing one who no longer uses the Services).
